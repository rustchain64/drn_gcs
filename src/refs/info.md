### Explanation of the Additional Components

1. **Handling ICE Candidates**: The example subscribes to the ICE candidate events and prints them out. In a real application, these candidates should be sent to the remote peer via your signaling server so that the peers can discover the best path for the media.

2. **Creating an Offer**: The `create_offer` method is used to initiate a WebRTC connection. The offer contains all the necessary media and network information that the remote peer needs to know to establish a connection.

3. **Setting Local Description**: After creating an offer, it is set as the local description of the peer connection. This step is essential as it finalizes the local media and network settings.

4. **Signaling**: The example comments suggest how you would typically integrate signaling to send the offer to a remote peer and receive an answer. This would involve using some network mechanism like WebSockets, HTTP requests, or any other real-time communication protocol suitable for your application.

5. **Connection State Monitoring**: The connection state change handler will inform you about changes in the peer connection state, such as connecting, connected, disconnected, etc.

6. **Shutdown**: The example waits for a `ctrl+c` signal to shut down, which keeps the program running until it is manually interrupted. This is useful during development to observe the behavior of the application over time.

This extended example illustrates a basic setup and management of a WebRTC peer connection in Rust using the `webrtc` crate. Remember, for a complete and operational WebRTC-based application, you will need to implement additional logic to handle answers, renegotiations, error handling, and possibly media (audio/video) management depending on your specific use case.
